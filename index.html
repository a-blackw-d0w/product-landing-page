        <h1>What Does a Lawyer Do?</h1>
        <p>
          Lawyers provide advice and recommendations to clients regarding their
          legal rights and obligations. Also known as an attorney, a lawyer
          represents individuals and businesses during legal proceedings and
          disputes. Lawyers' clients may include individuals, groups, or
          businesses. Lawyer work includes researching applicable laws and prior
          court rulings, preparing legal documents, and, when necessary, arguing
          cases in court. Through their education and work experience, attorneys
          can specialize in a number of areas including civil rights, employment
          law, immigration law, and intellectual property.

      <h1>Guide to Hiring a Lawyer</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Having the right attorney when you need one can help you resolve a
        dispute with neighbors, end a marriage, enforce your rights in the
        workplace, or even avoid prison time. When life gets legal, whether it's
        a DUI charge or a positive event such as adoption, it often makes sense
        to get a lawyer. But hiring a lawyer is not necessary for all legal
        procedures, which is why FindLaw provides free legal information, as
        well as do-it-yourself resources.<br />

      <h1>Criminal justice</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Criminal justice is the delivery of justice to those who have committed
        crimes. The criminal justice system is a series of government agencies
        and institutions. Goals include the rehabilitation of offenders,
        preventing other crimes, and moral support for victims. The primary
        institutions of the criminal justice system are the police, prosecution
        and defense lawyers, the courts and prisons.<br />

      <h1>Definition of Insurance Law</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        In order to understand insurance law, it is useful to understand
        insurance first. Insurance is a contract in which one party (the
        "insured") pays money (called a premium) and the other party promises to
        reimburse the first for certain types of losses (illness, property
        damage, or death) if they occur. Insurance law falls into three major
        categories. First, the insurance company will hire lawyers to represent
        the insured in case she is sued for something related to her insurance
        contract. These are known as "insurance defense attorneys." For example,
        an automobile insurance company will hire an attorney to represent an
        insured driver when she gets sued for causing another driver's injuries.
      </p>
      <br />
      The second category of insurance law helps insured people determine when
      an insurance company must pay a claim. Third, insurance companies
      typically hire attorneys to make sure the company complies with all
      applicable laws and regulations, which can vary by state.<br />
      <p>
        There are many types of insurance. The government runs some kinds of
        insurance, like Social Security disability, worker's compensation, and
        unemployment insurance. However, the term "insurance law" usually refers
        to the law surrounding private insurance. The most common types of
        private insurance are health insurance, automobile liability insurance,
        homeowner's insurance, life insurance, title insurance, and malpractice
        insurance.<br />
